# Resume-Matching Engine

Welcome to the Resume-Matching Engine! This project is an Applicant Tracking System (ATS) designed to help recruiters manage job postings, parse resumes, and rank candidates efficiently. The system features a clean user interface and a responsive Dashboard, making the recruitment process smoother and more effective.

Key Features:

Job Posting: Easily post job openings for candidates to apply.

Resume Parsing: Analyze resumes to extract relevant skills and qualifications.

Dashboard: Get an overview of job openings, top candidate matches, and detailed analytics.

Comprehensive Analysis: Go beyond basic resume parsing by analyzing the entire resume to identify key skills.

Personalized Recommendations: Provide tailored job opportunities, recommended skills, certifications, and courses to help candidates improve their profiles.

Resume Scoring: Offer a score to indicate how well a resume aligns with target job roles.

Real-Time Job Openings: Highlight current job openings that match the candidate's profile.

Solution Approach:

Gap Identification: We recognized the limitations of traditional ATS systems and developed an engine that not only filters resumes but also actively supports candidates in their job search and career development.

End-to-End Support: From extracting relevant skills to recommending jobs, skills, and courses, our system ensures that candidates are well-prepared and competitive.

Optimization: The resume scoring feature allows candidates to understand how to improve their resumes for specific job roles.
