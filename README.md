# Resume-Matching Engine


Welcome to the Resume-Matching Engine! This project is an Applicant Tracking System (ATS) designed to streamline recruitment by offering job posting, resume parsing, and candidate ranking features, all within a clean and responsive user interface. The Dashboard provides an easy-to-use overview of job openings, top candidate matches, and detailed analytics, enabling recruiters to match candidates to roles quickly and effectively. Our system goes beyond basic resume filtering by analyzing the entire resume to extract relevant skills, providing personalized recommendations for job opportunities, skills, certifications, and courses to help candidates improve their profiles. Additionally, the resume scoring feature offers insight into how well a resume aligns with target job roles, and real-time job openings are highlighted to keep candidates updated with market opportunities.


We developed the Resume-Matching Engine to address the limitations of traditional ATS systems by offering end-to-end support for candidates in their job search and career development. This includes not only filtering resumes but also actively helping candidates prepare and optimize their profiles for specific job roles. The system ensures that both recruiters and candidates have the tools they need for a more efficient and successful recruitment process. We hope you find this tool helpful, and we welcome any feedback or contributions to improve the system further.
