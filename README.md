# Resume-Matching Engine


Welcome to the Resume-Matching Engine! This project is an Applicant Tracking System (ATS) designed to help recruiters manage the entire recruitment process more efficiently. It includes features like job posting, resume parsing, and candidate ranking, all presented through a clean user interface and a responsive Dashboard. These tools work together to make the recruitment process smoother and more effective, allowing recruiters to easily post job openings, analyze resumes to extract relevant skills and qualifications, and get a clear overview of job openings, top candidate matches, and detailed analytics.


Our system goes beyond basic resume filtering by performing a comprehensive analysis of each resume to identify key skills. It also provides personalized recommendations, offering tailored job opportunities, suggested skills, certifications, and courses to help candidates improve their profiles. Additionally, the resume scoring feature gives candidates a score that indicates how well their resume aligns with target job roles. The system also keeps candidates updated with real-time job openings that match their profiles. We recognized the limitations of traditional ATS systems and developed this engine to actively support candidates in their job search and career development. By offering end-to-end support—from skill extraction to job recommendations and resume optimization—our system ensures that candidates are well-prepared and competitive in the job market.
