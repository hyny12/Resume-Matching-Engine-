#Resume Matching Engine
Welcome to the Resume Matching Engine! This project is an Applicant Tracking System (ATS) designed to simplify recruitment by offering features such as job posting, resume parsing, and candidate ranking, all within a clean and responsive user interface. The Dashboard provides a straightforward overview of job openings, top candidate matches, and detailed analytics, enabling recruiters to efficiently match candidates to roles. Our system goes beyond basic resume filtering by thoroughly analyzing resumes to extract relevant skills, providing personalized recommendations for job opportunities, skills, certifications, and courses. Additionally, the resume scoring feature gives insight into how well a resume aligns with target job roles, while real-time job openings keep candidates updated with market opportunities.

The Resume Matching Engine was developed to address the limitations of traditional ATS systems by offering end-to-end support for candidates in their job search and career development. It not only filters resumes but also actively assists candidates in preparing and optimizing their profiles for specific job roles. The system ensures that both recruiters and candidates have the necessary tools for a more efficient and successful recruitment process. We hope you find this tool valuable, and we welcome any feedback or contributions to help us improve the system.
